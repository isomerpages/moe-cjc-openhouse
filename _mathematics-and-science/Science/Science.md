#### **CJC SCIENCE ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES**

Our students embark on a range of science activities, competitions and research programmes, on top of their core science H1 &amp; H2 subjects, to further equip themselves with essential skills and knowledge necessary for higher education. Some of these programme provide students with the rare opportunities to work with Research Institutes and universities so that they can make well informed decisions in their choice of study or career after junior college.

  

**Our students have participated in a host of programmes, activities and competitions in recent years. These programmes have been categorized into 5 CORE Areas.**

  

**Creativity &amp; Innovation**&nbsp;– Students develop their creativity and construct scientific knowledge through the development of ideas/ products (e.g. Greenwave Environmental Care Competition, Singapore Space Challenge, STEP Environment Camp etc.)

  

**Academic Competitions**&nbsp;– Students’ knowledge of content beyond the syllabus is assessed and they develop their critical thinking through these rigorous cognitive competitions (e.g. Astrochallenge, Biology, Chemistry &amp; Physics Olympiads, Lee Kong Chian Anatomy Challenge, International Biomedical Quiz, Elementz Research Competition etc.)

  

**Research Programmes**&nbsp;with local universities and science research institutes (e.g. Science Research Programme with NUS, Nanyang Research Programme with NTU, SUTD Research Mentorship Programme etc.)

  

**Enrichment (Local &amp; Overseas)**&nbsp;– Our students gain greater clarity of what they want to do in future by exposing themselves to these enrichments related to various scientific areas (e.g. Work attachment with NanoBio Lab, stretch academic trips to various overseas universities, Materials Exposition at NTU, STEP NUS Sunburst Brain Camp, Nara Senior High School – CJC Science Exchange Programme etc.)

  

**Servant Leadership**&nbsp;– Our science students develop their leadership skills as they develop and facilitate science programmes for their college &amp; larger community (e.g. Facilitating CJC STEM Fest programmes and morning assembly reflections, Collaboration with Science Centre to teach the public about chromatography etc.)

My journey through the STEP Environment Camp was an enriching and enjoyable one. I was exposed to the different natural biodiversity Singapore has, such as the marine and mangrove environment, and learnt about the devastating impacts of improper waste treatment on these fragile ecosystems. Additionally, the camp has given me the opportunity to meet new friends from 12 different countries and work with them for our end-of-camp presentation, for which my group was awarded 1st place. Although the camp was draining, it definitely helped me gain more knowledge about other countries and grow to appreciate our natural environment even more.
