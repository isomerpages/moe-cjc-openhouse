#### **About the Programme**

The value of learning H2 Biology ultimately hinges on the development of a scientific mind and dispositions while addressing the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained. The Science Curriculum Framework developed by the Ministry of Education elaborates on the development of the scientific mind and dispositions. Through the study of the H2 Biology course, students should be prepared for life science-related courses at university and, consequently, careers that are related to this field.

#### **Prerequisites/Suitability**

The Biology syllabus is developed as a seamless continuum from O-levels to A-levels, without the need for topics to be revisited at A-level. The O-level syllabus is foundational and thus should provide the necessary background for study at A-level. Students who intend to offer H2 Biology will therefore be assumed to have the knowledge and understanding of O-level Biology.

#### **Enrichment Opportunities**

The CJC Biology Department affords every student the opportunity to participate in external enrichment activities and competitions yearly. These competitions expose students to the wider, more practical applications of Biology and in some instances even give them a chance to interact with professionals in the research industry. CJC students that represent the school in these competitions are given ample resources and rigorous training in preparation. Competitions we participate in regularly include the Singapore Biology Olympiad, the International Biomedical Quiz, the Lee Kong Chian Anatomy Challenge, and the STEP NUS Brain &amp; Environment Camps. We also conduct a yearly learning journey to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum with our JC2 cohort to learn how fossils aid us in the understanding of evolution.
