#### **H3 Physics**

H3 Physics will be offered only to JC2 students. The H3 Physics syllabus is designed around specific areas of specialization. Students can choose to take the in-house MOE H3 Physics offered in Catholic Junior College or the external H3 Physics course at the National Technological University.

Students intending to offer H3 Physics should simultaneously offer H2 Physics and possess a strong passion in the area of specialisation. In addition, other factors for consideration include: consistently good academic performance, good learning attitude and behaviour, and teachers' recommendations.
