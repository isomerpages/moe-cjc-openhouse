### Mathematics

  

#### About the Programme

  

The CJC Mathematics department aims to nurture effective problem solvers and critical thinkers based on the Singapore Mathematics Framework:

* Understanding and applying mathematical concepts and skills in a variety of contexts, including the manipulation of mathematical expressions and the use of graphic calculators 
* Reasoning and communicating mathematically through writing mathematical explanations, arguments and proofs, and inferences 
* Solving unfamiliar problems; translating common realistic contexts into mathematics; interpreting and evaluating mathematical results, and using the results to make predictions, or comment on the context

The department builds a strong foundation in Mathematics students, using Polya’s Problem Solving Model and caters to the varying readiness of students through differentiated instruction pedagogy. Other key teaching approaches regularly used by the department include mathematical modelling, teacher-directed inquiry, blended learning and Mathematical discourses (Stein).

A graphic calculator (GC) is a key learning tool that is designed to help students visualize and better understand concepts in mathematics and science, and the use of a GC is expected for all Mathematics subjects. Examination papers will be set with the assumption that candidates will have access to a GC. The college uses the model by Texas Instruments.

#### Prerequisites/Suitability

Learning Mathematics is optional at the A-Level. However, it is offered by almost all students. The purpose of reading A-Level Mathematics is two-fold. Firstly, it provides students, regardless of their intended course of study at University, with a useful set of tools and analytical skills to support not just tertiary study but also to sharpen their problem solving skills in the digital era. Secondly, learning mathematics exposes students to computational and logical thinking that complements other ways of thinking developed through the other disciplines.

To cater to the diverse needs, interests and abilities of students, the A-Level Mathematics Curriculum offered by the department comprises a suite of 3 syllabuses:<br>
* H1 Mathematics;
* H2 Mathematics and
* H3 Mathematics (in collaboration with SAJC and NUS and NTU-NIE)

H1 Mathematics is designed to provide students with a foundation in mathematics and statistics that will support their business or social sciences studies at the university. It is particularly appropriate for students without an Additional Mathematics background because it offers an opportunity for them to learn important mathematical concepts and skills in algebra and calculus that are covered in Additional Mathematics. Students will also learn basic statistical methods that are necessary for studies in business and social sciences. 
<br>Assumed knowledge: **G3 Mathematics**

H2 Mathematics is designed to prepare students for a range of university courses, including mathematics, sciences and related courses, where a good foundation in mathematics is required. It develops mathematical thinking and reasoning skills that are essential for further learning of mathematics. Through the applications of mathematics, students also develop an appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and to the real world. 
<br>Assumed knowledge: **G3 Additional Mathematics**

Students without G3 Additional Mathematics (e.g. those who offered G2 Additional Mathematics or just G3 Mathematics) may offer H2 Mathematics but will be required to bridge the knowledge gap during the course of study. In CJC, they will be identified through a Readiness Assessment and attend a compulsory bridging programme if needed. 

H3 Mathematics is designed for students with the passion and ability in mathematics. It aims to engage students who are keen to specialise in mathematics in solving more challenging problems in mathematics and proving mathematical results. Students will learn useful techniques and results, related to the content in H2 Mathematics, to solve mathematical problems and prove mathematical statements. In the course of learning, students will develop an understanding of the rigour of mathematics and mathematical proof and a deeper insight into the practice, value and beauty of mathematics. 
<br> Pre-requisite: H2 Mathematics

#### Assessment
Formative and Summative Assessment Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning. It can be formative or summative or both.

The process of assessment is embedded in the planning of the lessons. Various teaching actions will be integrated into classroom instruction to help teachers to check if learning is taking place as intended, and how students can build on past knowledge and experiences to move forward in their learning. 
The embedding of assessment process may take the following forms: <br>
* Class Activities 
* Classroom Discourse 
* Individual or Group Tasks

Assessment provides feedback for both students and teachers. 

##### School-based Assessments 
We will carry out our own school-based assessments (SBA), which could be formative or summative, at different stages of students’ learning and at different points in time. 

**Changes to SBA (from 2024 JC1 Intake)**<br>
Mid-year Examination will be removed in phases: JC1/Pre-U1 in 2024, JC2/Pre-U2 in 2025, and Pre-U3 in 2026. 

As with the primary and secondary schools, changes to SBA for the JCs/MI are intended to support schools in reducing the excessive focus on examinations, and provide more time and space for the development of 21CC. This will also provide JC/MI students with a more coherent education experience as they transit from secondary education to the A-Level. 

When planning SBA, the department will adopt the three guiding principles from MOE: <br>
* Guiding Principle 1: Schools should use assessment information to provide feedback to students, improve teaching and learning practices, and make sound school-based decisions on assessment-related issues. 
* Guiding Principle 2: Schools should design assessments according to the stipulated assessment objectives in the subject syllabuses. 
* Guiding Principle 3: Schools should ensure a manageable assessment load and demand on students that supports sustainable learning when drawing up assessment plans and schedules. 

##### National Examinations 
The first year of examination of the revised H1 Mathematics, H2 Mathematics, and H3 Mathematics is 2025.

**Assessment Objectives and Weightings** <br>
The assessment objectives (AOs) reflect the emphases of the syllabuses and describe what students should know and be able to do with the concepts and skills learned in each syllabus. In alignment with the 2020 Secondary Mathematics Curriculum, the AOs for the A-Level Mathematics Curriculum have been revised to reflect the cognitive skills required to solve examination questions. 

**Assessment Objectives Descriptors** <br>
**AO1 Use mathematical techniques and procedures**
* Recall facts, formulae and notation and use them directly.  
*	Read and use information from tables, graphs, diagrams and texts. 
*	Carry out straightforward mathematical procedures. 

**AO2 Formulate and solve problems including those in real-world contexts**
* Select relevant mathematical concept or strategy to apply. 
*	Formulate problems into mathematical expressions or models. 
*	Integrate mathematical concepts to solve mathematical problems. 
*	Translate between equivalent forms of mathematical expressions or statements. 
*	Interpret results in the context of a given problem. 

**AO3 Reason and communicate mathematically**
* Explain the choice of mathematical models or strategies. 
* Make deductions, inferences and generalisations. 
* Formulate conjectures and justify mathematical statements. 
* Construct mathematical arguments and proofs.

Approximate weightings for the AOs have also been introduced. More details will be given in due course.

#### Stretch Programmes
1. **International Mathematical Modelling Challenge**<br>
Organised by Mathematical Modelling Singapore, the Challenge seeks to promote the teaching of mathematical modelling and applications to all ages. This is based on the belief that the use of Mathematics helps one to better understand, analyse and solve real-life problems that are seemingly not related to Mathematics.<br><br>
The competition is open to JC2 students who are shortlisted based on their JC1 performance and tutor recommendations. The shortlisted students are mentored by a teacher advisor who will prepare them for the Challenge.<br><br>
**WOW Factor**: Real world problems require students to integrate knowledge from different topics of Mathematics for their analysis and solution. Real problems take time and teamwork. The IMMC provides students with a deeper experience both of how mathematics can explain our world and what working with mathematics looks like. The participants have to be resourceful, do independent research as well as work closely as a team. One of the team members must have knowledge of Python programming. Students also have the opportunity to hone their Scientific Report Summary writing skills. Team CJC has consistently been achieving at least a merit in the Challenge in the last 5 years.

*   Reasoning and communicating mathematically through writing mathematical explanations, arguments and proofs, and inferences
*   Solving unfamiliar problems; translate common realistic contexts into mathematics; interpret and evaluate mathematical results, and use the results to make predictions, or comment on the context

#### **Difference between Mathematics at A- and O-Levels**

In secondary schools, all students learn O-Level Mathematics while students with an aptitude and interest in mathematics also offer Additional Mathematics. The learning of Mathematics at the A-Level builds on students’ prior knowledge and skills in O-Level Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.

  

To cater to the diverse needs, interests, and abilities of students, we offer the following 3 syllabuses:

  

*   H1 Mathematics;
*   H2 Mathematics and
*   H3 Mathematics

  

O-Level Mathematics provides the assumed knowledge for H1 Mathematics while H2 Mathematics assumes some of the content covered in Additional Mathematics. H3 Mathematics is an extension of H2 Mathematics in terms of higher-order problem solving skills.

#### **Assessment in the new Curriculum**

Broadly speaking, students will be assessed on three levels:

  

*   Understanding and applying mathematical or statistical concepts and skills in a variety of problems including those that may be set in unfamiliar context or require integration of concepts and skills from more than one topic;
*   Formulating real-world problems mathematically, solve the mathematical problems, interpret and evaluate the mathematical solutions in the context of the problems; and
*   Reasoning and communicating mathematically through making deductions and writing mathematical explanations, arguments of varying rigour, and proofs.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1\. Should I do H1 or H2 Mathematics?** <br>
You should consider H2 Mathematics if you  

*   are interested in science, strong in Mathematics and offer mathematics because it supports your future in science (excluding biological sciences).

OR

*   are generally strong in mathematics, but prefer a non-science-based course and intend to offer mathematics as a contrasting subject.

  

You should consider H1 Mathematics if you

*   are more inclined towards the arts and humanities;
*   intend to offer Mathematics as a contrasting subject;
*   intend to pursue business, social sciences or biological sciences at the university;
*   have no Additional Mathematics background

  

**2\. If I have no Additional Mathematics background, can I still take H2 Mathematics?** <br>
If you are very clear of the purpose of taking H2 mathematics, you can still take H2 Mathematics provided you meet the college merit-based criteria (please refer to the subject combination section).&nbsp;You must be prepared to spend more time outside curriculum time to do the catching up. You must also consider the time needed for other subjects who are new to you, such as General Paper and Project Work.

**3\. What is this Graphing Calculator?** <br>
Essentially, a graphing calculator (GC) is a learning tool that is designed to help students visualize and better understand concepts in mathematics and science, and the use of a GC is expected for H1, H2 &amp; H3 Mathematics. Examination papers will be set with the assumption that candidates will have access to a GC. The college uses the model by Texas Instruments.

**The following are our niche programmes:**

1.  **International Mathematical Modelling Challenge**

Organised by Mathematical Modelling Singapore, the Challenge seeks to promote the teaching of mathematical modelling and applications of mathematics to all ages. This is based on the belief that the use of mathematics is helpful to better understand, analyze and solve real-life problems that are seemingly not related to mathematics.

  

Participants of this competition are shortlisted based on their JC1 performance and recommendation from tutors. The shortlisted students are mentored by a teacher advisor who will prepare them for the challenge.

  

**WOW Factor**: Real world problems require students to integrate knowledge from different topics of mathematics for their analysis and solution. And real problems take time and teamwork. The IM2C provides students with a deeper experience both of how mathematics can explain our world and what working with mathematics looks like. The participants have to be resourceful, do independent research as well as work closely as a team. One of the team members must have knowledge of Python programming. Students also have the opportunity to hone their Scientific Report Summary writing skills.

2.  **Data Science Competition**

This is a team-based competition open to students in their second year. Organized by the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability of the NUS, the annual competition encourages students to explore creative data displays.

  

**WOW Factor**: Mentored by a tutor, participants are challenged to apply research skills and perform statistical analysis using concepts that they learnt from H2 Maths as well as H2 Further Maths to create a poster of an authentic social issue of their interest. Students also have the opportunity to hone their skills in data collection, statistical report writing, and design.

3.  **Design using Graphing Calculator Competition**

The competition is open to all students studying in a Junior College / Centralised Institute or a Secondary School in Singapore or the equivalent in Malaysia.

  

**WOW Factor**: Participants are challenged to do independent research and use the Texas Instruments Graphing Calculator to create artwork based on a theme. They get to appreciate how to apply knowledge of the different graphs of H2 Maths and Further Maths to design!
