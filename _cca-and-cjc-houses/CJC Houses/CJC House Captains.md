For me there were two defining features of CJ that set it apart and after coming here, it was made all the more apparent. First, I have made some of my best friends here. The people here are kind hearted, funny and sweet. Especially during celebrations, the bond between classmates becomes so strong. Next, it will have to be the teachers. The teachers here are extremely caring. They will go above and beyond to ensure your well-being.
