For me there were two defining features of CJ that set it apart and after coming here, it was made all the more apparent. First, I have made some of my best friends here. The people here are kind hearted, funny and sweet. Especially during celebrations, the bond between classmates becomes so strong. Next, it will have to be the teachers. The teachers here are extremely caring. They will go above and beyond to ensure your well-being.

Since coming to a new&nbsp;environment is so daunting, the Student Development Programme sessions really helped me get to know everyone on a real and intimate level which ultimately helped me form more meaningful friendships in CJ! Good support is always appreciated, especially since JC is so rigorous and fast-paced. My teachers are always gracious with their time for consultations and my friends are always there when I need help in our homework. I'm thankful I have both my teachers and my friends to support and ground me since JC is so academically demanding.
