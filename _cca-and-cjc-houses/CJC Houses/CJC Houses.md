<h4><strong>Unite to Ignite</strong></h4>
<p>The CJC House system is a historic feature in Catholic Junior College,
with the houses initially named after the saints Patrick, Joseph, Michael,
Albert, John and Gregory.</p>
<p>These six houses would be a symbol of the college's treasured legacy,
giving students a balanced life in the college, a sense of belonging and
camaraderie in competition. The CJC Houses participate in a wide range
of activities and competitions, both physical and non-physical:</p>

<p>Reintroduced in 2012, the House system would maintain four existing names,
taking on the colours of the college:&nbsp;<strong>Albert (Yellow), Michael (Orange), Patrick (Red) and Joseph (Green)</strong>.
These names were chosen because they reflect our treasured legacy, taking
on the names of our founders and principals. Each CJC House is headed by
a PE teacher as House Master / Mistress and led by a committee of JC2 students:
a House Captain, a Vice-House Captain, a House Secretary, a House Games
Representative, House JC1 Level Representatives and various House Leaders.</p>
