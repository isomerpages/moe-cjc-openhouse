<p>Co-Curricular Activities play a key role in the holistic development of
a student. They can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular
activity; develop robustness, fair play and team spirit; a sense of graciousness
and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial
society; and inculcate self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit
of service to other.</p>
<p>In CJC, all students are encouraged and expected to be involved in CCAs.
CCAs offer an excellent opportunity for all students to be immersed in
an area of interest based on their motivation and strength. CCAs are part
of the students’ Co-Curricular Programme and their experience in the two
years of college education will be reflected to a large extent in their
LEAPS certificate. This certificate encapsulates all Leadership, Enrichment,
Achievement and Service opportunities that the students are involved in.</p>
<p>In their CCAs, students will have the opportunity to develop their Leadership
abilities in formal positions. Their experience is supported by school-wide
leadership training at certain milestones in the year such as CJC’s Leadership
Dialogue, Leadership Training Camp and Leadership Conference.</p>
<p>Most CCAs have professional coaches and instructors. Teachers offer the
main character building support and ensure that the students are always
safe and have the best possible experience.</p>

<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Q1) Will I be given my 1st&nbsp;choice CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>In CJC, the college will organise a “CCA Bazaar” in Term 1 for students
to have a better sense of the range of CCAs offered. Some CCAs will organise
auditions for students to demonstrate and showcase their skills and talents.
Thereafter, students will be given the opportunity to submit 4 choices
for their CCAs. The College will aim to allocate every student one of their
4 CCA choices; with a large number of students offered one of their top
2 or 3 choices.</p>
<p><strong>Q2) Can I have two CCAs?</strong>
</p>
<p>We encourage students to focus on one CCA given the busy schedule of the
JC curriculum.&nbsp;However, there are some students in CJC who opt to
participate in another CCA, namely&nbsp;Genesis, given their keen interest
in these activities. This 2nd&nbsp;CCA is less intensive with only 1 CCA
practice per week and their activity is recreational in nature. Students
must maintain their good academic performance in order to continue with
two CCAs throughout their JC course.</p>
<p><strong>Q3) Can I be in CCA that is not offered in the school, i.e. an external CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>All CJCians are strongly encouraged to have one school-based CCA. CCA
is an important platform to learn important life-skills, build positive
relationships and build a sense of community and belonging in the college.</p>
<p>An exception is made for students who participate at the National level
in a CCA not offered by the school.&nbsp; For such students, their primary
CCA would be external but they would normally opt for one of the 2nd&nbsp;CCAs
offered by the school in order to participate in the school’s CCA system
and benefit from its character and leadership development programme.</p>
<p><strong>Q4) Is CCA compulsory?</strong>
</p>
<p>Every CJCian is expected to have one CCA in CJC as CCAs are an important
platform for character and leadership development. CCAs are also a key
aspect of the holistic education programme in CJC.</p>
<p><strong>Q5) Is there a minimum attendance rate for CCA?</strong>
</p>
<p>CJCians are strongly encouraged to maintain regular attendance in their
CCAs. Regular attendance will enable the student to benefit from the CCA's
skills training, character and leadership development programme. A minimum
attendance rate of 75% in the year is expected. If students are not able
to attend CCA practices, a valid reason such as a medical certificate must
be produced to the CCA teacher-in-charge.</p>
