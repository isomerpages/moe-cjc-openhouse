#### **About the Programme**

General Paper encourages students to actively explore a range of key issues of global, regional and local significance and be ready to meet the challenges of higher education and the workplace of the future. Students appreciate the interrelationship of ideas, and become more adept at interpreting and evaluating the complexities of the world we live in. They also develop the disposition of active inquiry, the habit of reflection, the willingness to convey their views in a balanced, thoughtful manner, guiding them to make responsible decisions and to contribute constructively towards their communities.
