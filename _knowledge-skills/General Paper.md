#### **About the Programme**

General Paper encourages students to actively explore a range of key issues of global, regional and local significance and be ready to meet the challenges of higher education and the workplace of the future. Students appreciate the interrelationship of ideas, and become more adept at interpreting and evaluating the complexities of the world we live in. They also develop the disposition of active inquiry, the habit of reflection, the willingness to convey their views in a balanced, thoughtful manner, guiding them to make responsible decisions and to contribute constructively towards their communities.

#### **Prerequisites/Suitability**

It is compulsory for all JC students to offer General Paper at the A-Levels.&nbsp;  

While students should find the essay writing and comprehension components familiar, having experienced a similar examination format at the O-Levels, General Paper demands depth of argumentation and critical thinking skills that are much more advanced than at the O-Level. CJC provides students with a foundation in thinking skills and content to allow them to craft well-reasoned arguments.  

Above all, consistent effort and practice ensures success at the A-Levels.
