<h4><strong>About the Programme</strong></h4><p><a href="/files/2a__General_Paper___An_Overview_pptx.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">General Paper - An Overview</a></p><p>General Paper encourages students to actively explore a range of key issues of global, regional and local significance and be ready to meet the challenges of higher education and the workplace of the future. Students appreciate the interrelationship of ideas, and become more adept at interpreting and evaluating the complexities of the world we live in. They also develop the disposition of active inquiry, the habit of reflection, the willingness to convey their views in a balanced, thoughtful manner, guiding them to make responsible decisions and to contribute constructively towards their communities.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:85%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/aboutprog.png"></div><h4><strong>A Level Syllabus</strong></h4><p>Click the following link for an overview of the General Paper syllabus as well as the assessment format: <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/8881_y24_sy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">General Paper (Syllabus 8881) - First examination in 2024</a></p><h4><strong>Prerequisites/Suitability</strong></h4><p>It is compulsory for all JC students to offer General Paper at the A-Levels.&nbsp;</p><p>While students should find the essay writing and comprehension components familiar, having experienced a similar examination format at the O-Levels, General Paper demands depth of argumentation and critical thinking skills that are much more advanced than at the O-Level. CJC provides students with a foundation in thinking skills and content to allow them to craft well-reasoned arguments.</p><p>Above all, consistent effort and practice ensures success at the A-Levels.</p><h4><strong>Pedagogical Tools</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="417" width="307" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CDXigCUWHW8ixPRtUc8acHU62gG6ZRHI52z4rroG-PB58JTdw0N-elfHXlYT8fjuCE4ci_7X9_N4nX4KsEiI8hH7AYpw9P75QfZH9vC1rRZKgtTpaD01ANgH_2nnGJ5l9Ou3YWjjlmCkB75gzL3lnw"></div><h4><strong>Student Testimonials</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="339" width="602" alt="Diagram, timeline

World Philosophy Day Essay Writing Competition</strong></p><p>An annual philosophy essay writing competition organised in celebration of World Philosophy Day (21 November 2024).</p><p>The contemporary philosopher, Anthony Grayling, believes that philosophy should play a useful role in society and public policy (not just in academia). This essay writing competition challenges students to use critical thinking, logical reasoning and rational argumentation – characteristic methods of philosophical inquiry and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.
