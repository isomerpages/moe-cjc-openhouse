Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Q1)** **If my/my child’s L1R5 net aggregate score is one point lower than last year’s, is it safe to apply to CJ?**

The L1R5 net aggregate scores for admission to CJC are not pre-determined by MOE or schools before posting. The eventual course aggregate scores for 2021 Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) may vary from previous years’ as they are contingent on the GCE O-Level examination results and the students’ course choices during the JAE. 

**Q2) If I put CJC as my 2nd choice, am I eligible for affiliation/bonus points?**

CJC must be indicated as the first choice OR your first **and** second choice based on Arts/Science course respectively, before you are given bonus points for affiliation.

That is, to be eligible for the bonus points, you must be from one of the 15 secondary schools affiliated to CJC, and you must indicate your choice order as such:

1st choice: CJC (Arts)

2nd choice: CJC (Science)

For more information on bonus points for admission, visit [https://beta.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/admission-criteria/?pt=JC](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/admission-criteria/?pt=JC)

For list of the secondary schools affiliated to Catholic Junior College, visit [https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/about/our-history](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/about/our-history) 

 **Q3) I have 11 points. Can I appeal to do 4H2 subjects?**

Students who have obtained 10 points or better for their L1R5 raw aggregate and 8 points or better in their four relevant O-Level subjects, are eligible to take four H2 content-based subjects, of which at least one must be from a contrasting discipline. If you do not meet the criteria, you may appeal to do four H2 subjects.  Appeals will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis keeping in mind the student’s abilities and aptitude.  

**Q4) Will I obtain the subject combination which I opted for?**

The College adopts a merit-based allocation process in the selection of students for the subject combination they have opted for, taking into consideration the number of applicants and the number of places available for each subject. In the event that a subject is over-subscribed, students will be selected based on academic merit, which is:

i)                L1R5 raw aggregate (_excluding_ bonus points) or equivalent; and

ii)              performance in the relevant subject(s).

 For more information, visit [https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/admission/subject-combinations-2021](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/admission/subject-combinations-2021)

**Q5)  How does a student apply for the CJC Ignite Talent Development Programme?**

All JC1 students admitted to CJC will be invited to apply for the Ignite Programme. Selection tests and interviews will be conducted in Term 1 during the Orientation programme. For more information on the Ignite Programme, visit  [https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/education/ignite-programme](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/education/ignite-programme)
