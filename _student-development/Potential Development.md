Catholic Junior College offers a structured Potential Development Programme as part of CCE. With the belief that every CJCian has the capacity to learn, to excel, and to leverage on their unique talents to achieve their goals, the Potential Development Programme seeks to guide students in making informed education and career choices, where they can make a positive impact on the wider community as Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart.

#### **Education and Career Guidance**

The Education and Career Guidance Team provides our students with the required support for them to gain a deeper self-awareness of their unique interests, talents and aspirations, and to explore viable education and career options through the provision of accurate and comprehensive information. The team is active in establishing and maintaining viable relationships with CJCâ€™s various partners, such as the local Autonomous Universities (AUs), foreign universities, scholarship boards, and industry professionals. Through our various initiatives, students are inculcated with an appreciation for the value of all education and career pathways, and to reflect on how they themselves can contribute to the well-functioning of society beyond Junior College.
