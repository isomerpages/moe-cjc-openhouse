In CJC, student leadership development permeates across all students at various tiers â€“ Home Tutorial Groups (Class Management Committee), Co-Curricular Activities and within the House System and at the highest level, in the Student Council. Training and mentorship are provided to help all students to grow as Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart. These platforms include Class Management Committee (CMC) Training Sessions, Leadership Training Camp and the Leadership Conference. The 4M Leadership for SOAR undergirds the various leadership training approaches.
