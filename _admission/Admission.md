At Catholic Junior College, our students take a two-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination. More than a school, **we offer a holistic education for life**. We want you to discover new ideas, think critically about them and find your purpose.

  

**We are an inclusive community** that welcomes you regardless of your background. Attendance at Catholic activities is not compulsory. We believe in being open to different perspectives and opinions - this is the spirit of a CJC education.

  

Here you will find information on how to enrol via the **Joint Admissions Exercise** / **Appeals** (JAE), **Direct Admissions Exercise** (DSA) and application criteria. For prospective and current students, details on **subject combinations**, **scholarships**, **financial assistance**, higher education and career **prospects** can be accessed here at our admissions site.
