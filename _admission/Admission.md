At Catholic Junior College, our students take a two-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination. More than a school,&nbsp;**we offer a holistic education for life**. We want you to discover new ideas, think critically about them and find your purpose.

  

**We are an inclusive community**&nbsp;that welcomes you regardless of your background. Attendance at Catholic activities is not compulsory. We believe in being open to different perspectives and opinions - this is the spirit of a CJC education.

  

Here you will find information on how to enrol via the&nbsp;**Joint Admissions Exercise**&nbsp;/&nbsp;**Appeals**&nbsp;(JAE),&nbsp;**Direct Admissions Exercise**&nbsp;(DSA) and application criteria.
