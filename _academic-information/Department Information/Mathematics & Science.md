#### **STEM Education Programme**

In line with MOE’s strategic thrusts and college focus in providing differentiated support for students’ diverse interest and learning opportunities beyond the classroom, the college STEM Steering committee was set up to drive the STEM education programmes. In 2022, Dr Timothy Hu Xiao Ming&nbsp;–&nbsp;a data scientist from A\*STAR&nbsp;–&nbsp;will support the college in STEM education initiatives.&nbsp;

#### **1\. STEM Fest**

<img style="width:100%" src="/images/cjc%20stem%20picture%203.png">

STEM Fest is an annual collaboration between the Mathematics and the Science Departments to help all students recognize the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics) and appreciate its use in addressing real-world problems. The week-long event serves as an important platform to provide learning experiences for science students to acquire and apply their knowledge and skills from H2 subjects on STEM. It also allows Mathematics and Science student leaders to hone their organisation and leadership skills.

#### **2\. CJC-Nara High School Global Exchange Programme**

This month-long stretch programme is an annual exchange programme with Nara High School which is a Super Science School from Japan. Based on the theme of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, students representing the two schools collaborated on a joint research and identified how STEM helps the two countries achieve these sustainable development goals. In the process, students also get to interact and learn about each other’s culture as well as the respective countries’ journey to enhance sustainability. This programme culminated in a joint virtual presentation on the final day where students shared their findings.

#### **3\. STEM Local Leadership Stretch Programme**

The college organized the inaugural Local Leadership Programme known as CJC.STEM.SG to replace overseas academic trips for selected JC1 students. The 5-day programme with a hybrid format is based on the theme “A More Secure and Sustainable Singapore through STEM”.&nbsp;Conceptualised based on the Practices of Science,&nbsp;the programme&nbsp;provided a rich and rigorous learning experience ranging from keynote lecture by STEM experts in the fields of sustainability to workshops on topics such as Cryptography, Mathematical Modelling, Vaccine Development, and Arduino Masterclass by Spacecraft engineers. There are also virtual tours of the NTU Satellite Research Centre and local High Tech Farm and laboratory experiences investigating the science of alternate meat by local start-up&nbsp;firm&nbsp;Ants Innovate as well as&nbsp;Genetic Engineering by Amgen Science Centre Singapore.

Participants also had opportunities to do research, presented on five important challenges facing Singapore, and&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;innovative STEM-based solutions to a panel of judges which included an A\*star scientist.&nbsp;

Participants were also challenged to assume various leadership roles, including designing their own ZOOM virtual background as part of the programme.
