#### **About the Programme**

English Language and Linguistics (ELL) is an H2 subject that aims to develop studentsâ€™ understanding, use and appreciation of the English language through the discipline of Linguistics as well as investigation into the nature of the English language and contemporary linguistics issues.

  

The study of ELL would involve thinking about these core questions:

*   What is the English language?
    
*   How do speakers/writers choose to use the English language based on different contexts?
    
*   Why is it that some English speakers do not understand each other even though they speak the same language?
    
*   Does language determine thought?
    
*   Why do we need to be aware of linguistic choices we make especially in the area of politics, institutions and news media?
