#### **About the Programme**

The CJC Literature programme seeks to develop in students the skills of close reading, perspective taking, and thinking critically about the literary texts they read.

We hope that students acquire, through the programme, an open-minded disposition comfortable with productive ambiguity, independent insight, and the ability to communicate their ideas logically and effectively.  

Beyond the syllabus, we aim to nurture in students an enduring love for literature that is grounded in critical thought and appreciation of the text.

Second lesson sample: this audio file is part of a supplementary Podcast, an example of learning resources that augment core materials and lessons. In this short audio file, the lecturer meditates on one scene in William Shakespeare's&nbsp;_Hamlet_, using it as a springboard to consider the themes of corruption, misogyny, and the connection between the particular and the universal.

#### Student Testimonies
-------------------

“To speak authentically, taking Literature in CJ has been an experience like no other. It is truly respectable and inspiring to see teachers love what they do and put their hearts into each tutorial and lecture they give. Their passion is indeed contagious. I count myself extremely blessed to be taught by a group of individuals who are so intelligent and driven, yet so humble. They taught me that Literature is not just a subject to be studied, but instead, Literature is a beautiful artform to be appreciated. CJ teachers: they do the world’s poets and authors justice.” --&nbsp;**Ashley Chia, 2T01**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
“At the beginning of my JC1 year, my foundation in Literature was terribly shaky and I had several reservations about studying Literature in Junior College because of how badly I had performed in the subject in Secondary School. &nbsp;  
  
From the very first lesson, I encountered how amazing the CJ Literature department really is. Day by day of lectures and tutorials, lovingly taught by our caring and expert tutors, provided me with clarity and comprehension beyond measure and renewed my confidence in the subject once more. In fact, I believe that the very first Literature Lecture was so well-delivered, I have learnt as much in that lecture, as I had in the past four years of studying it! &nbsp;  
  
Several books, tutorials, essays and lectures later, I have emerged a student who knows not just WHAT is happening, but also HOW AND WHY things happen, which is what Literature essentially is. At the end of the day, the CJC Literature department doesn’t just teach you Literature. They allow you to experience it and build your own distinct understanding of it so that it can be utilized efficiently for the A Level examinations.” --&nbsp;**Alfonso Yuji Cortez, 2T03**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
“Being completely new to taking Literature as a subject, the H2 Literature teachers really aided me in easing into this foreign subject. They have ignited a great passion for the subject within me that I never thought I would find. &nbsp;  
  
With comprehensive and interesting lectures and tutorials that are often filled with laughter and deep introspection, my teachers never failed to make time to answer my queries and often went the extra mile to gather additional materials to link Literature themes to our daily lives, in order to help deepen our understanding of the books we&nbsp;analysed. All in all, having chosen to step out of my comfort zone to study H2 Literature in CJC is one of the best decisions I made.” --&nbsp;**Celine Silva, 2T05**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
“CJ Literature definitely lived up to the expectations I had. With laughter filled lessons that still thoroughly cover the selected texts, Lit is the one subject my entire class looks forward to! Every teacher in the Lit department is ever ready to offer their help. Be it daily consultation sessions or random questions that pop up at 2 in the morning, the teachers always address all doubts and concerns, while reserving all judgement. Lit is a challenging subject, but with the help of my tutors, I have grown to truly love and enjoy it.” --&nbsp;**Maddie Chau, 2T07
