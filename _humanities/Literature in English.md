#### **About the Programme**

The CJC Literature programme seeks to develop in students the skills of close reading, perspective taking, and thinking critically about the literary texts they read.

We hope that students acquire, through the programme, an open-minded disposition comfortable with productive ambiguity, independent insight, and the ability to communicate their ideas logically and effectively.  

Beyond the syllabus, we aim to nurture in students an enduring love for literature that is grounded in critical thought and appreciation of the text.

#### **Student Testimonies**

“To speak authentically, taking Literature in CJ has been an experience like no other. It is truly respectable and inspiring to see teachers love what they do and put their hearts into each tutorial and lecture they give. Their passion is indeed contagious. I count myself extremely blessed to be taught by a group of individuals who are so intelligent and driven, yet so humble. They taught me that Literature is not just a subject to be studied, but instead, Literature is a beautiful artform to be appreciated. CJ teachers: they do the world’s poets and authors justice.” --&nbsp;**Ashley Chia, 2T01**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
“At the beginning of my JC1 year, my foundation in Literature was terribly shaky and I had several reservations about studying Literature in Junior College because of how badly I had performed in the subject in Secondary School. &nbsp;  
  
From the very first lesson, I encountered how amazing the CJ Literature department really is. Day by day of lectures and tutorials, lovingly taught by our caring and expert tutors, provided me with clarity and comprehension beyond measure and renewed my confidence in the subject once more. In fact, I believe that the very first Literature Lecture was so well-delivered, I have learnt as much in that lecture, as I had in the past four years of studying it! &nbsp;  
  
Several books, tutorials, essays and lectures later, I have emerged a student who knows not just WHAT is happening, but also HOW AND WHY things happen, which is what Literature essentially is. At the end of the day, the CJC Literature department doesn’t just teach you Literature. They allow you to experience it and build your own distinct understanding of it so that it can be utilized efficiently for the A Level examinations.” --&nbsp;**Alfonso Yuji Cortez, 2T03**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
“Being completely new to taking Literature as a subject, the H2 Literature teachers really aided me in easing into this foreign subject. They have ignited a great passion for the subject within me that I never thought I would find. &nbsp;  
  
With comprehensive and interesting lectures and tutorials that are often filled with laughter and deep introspection, my teachers never failed to make time to answer my queries and often went the extra mile to gather additional materials to link Literature themes to our daily lives, in order to help deepen our understanding of the books we&nbsp;analysed. All in all, having chosen to step out of my comfort zone to study H2 Literature in CJC is one of the best decisions I made.” --&nbsp;**Celine Silva, 2T05**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
“CJ Literature definitely lived up to the expectations I had. With laughter filled lessons that still thoroughly cover the selected texts, Lit is the one subject my entire class looks forward to! Every teacher in the Lit department is ever ready to offer their help. Be it daily consultation sessions or random questions that pop up at 2 in the morning, the teachers always address all doubts and concerns, while reserving all judgement. Lit is a challenging subject, but with the help of my tutors, I have grown to truly love and enjoy it.” --&nbsp;**Maddie Chau, 2T07**

_Litera_&nbsp;is the department’s literary festival, featuring creative works by our students based on their A-Level texts.

Just as letters make up Literature, these student pieces come together as discrete works adding to a larger corpus of creativity. Among the pieces we have seen: some are performances, or scripts for performances; others are poetry or prose in meditation of the source texts; still others are visual, as if in reverse ekphrasis of their texts.

The programme is open to all H1 and H2 Literature students. Selected pieces will be featured on the&nbsp;_Litera_&nbsp;website, and student artists will be invited to host dialogue sessions with their peers, sharing about their creative vision, process, and learning. Student visitors, in turn, have a chance to dialogue with the creators of these pieces, in an open and intelligent exchange.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1\. Is Literature at O-Level required to take Literature at A-Level?**

Experience of Literature at O-Level gives students some advantage but is not a pre-requisite for A-Level Literature. In both H1 and H2 Literature, we provide students a foundation in literary study, from the use of literary methods to the shaping of an interpretation.

**2\. What is the difference between H1 and H2 Literature?**

H1 students read only Paper 1, while H2 students read both Paper 1 and Paper 3. Literature students are expected to perform close reading of unseen and set texts, regardless of whether they are H1 or H2 students. This involves analysis of literary methods and effects. Mere paraphrasing or narration of the text does not count as analysis.

In Paper 1, H1 students study the same two texts as H2 students, attend the same Paper 1 lectures and take a similar examination. H1 students however are not required to demonstrate comparison skills in Section A (unseen poetry)
