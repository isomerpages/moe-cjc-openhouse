CJC Drama Society endeavours to convey stories of real people through minimalistic theatre. We hope to explore human nature through insightful productions, allowing us to grow in our understanding of ourselves and the world, and in our bond as one Drama family.

  

The COVID-19 pandemic left us caged within the four walls of our rooms with little chance for physical interaction, especially during the Circuit Breaker. However, despite prevailing safe distancing measures, we adapted to these new and strange times with the devoted guidance of our instructors to tell a story (four stories, to be exact). We distilled the human experiences that have emerged during this pandemic. Perhaps, you'll find your own story featured as we hold a mirror up to society to reflect difficulties we faced as individuals, and as a nation.
