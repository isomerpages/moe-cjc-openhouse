The Catholic Junior College Choir was founded in 2000 and remains a warm and unassuming family; a humble home for our passionate and enthusiastic choir members. The singers – regardless of their prior level of experience or musicality – develop not only their vocal skills and musicality, but also a deep appreciation for the magic of music-making as a team.

  

No prior experience is needed but a love for singing is recommended
