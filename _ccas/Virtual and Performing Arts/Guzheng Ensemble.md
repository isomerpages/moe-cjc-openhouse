The CJ Guzheng Ensemble provides opportunities for interested students to learn and master the skills of playing the Guzheng through various performance opportunities at SYF and CJ Celebrates.

  

As guzheng is a Chinese string instrument, it definitely allows for a greater appreciation of Chinese culture and music. However, you do not need to be well-versed in Chinese/Mandarin to be part of us!

  

Guys and Girls, everyone is welcome to join - you do not need to have any musical background to be part of our ensemble. We are a closely-knit family in tune with one another.
