<h2>Guitar Ensemble</h2>
<p>The CJ Guitar Ensemble provides opportunities for interested students
to learn and master the skills of playing the guitar through many performance
opportunities at SYF and guitar concerts. As we are a Niibori Guitar Ensemble,
you can choose to join the Alto, Prime, or Bass (including contrabass and
guitarron) section, where you will be taught the basics of musicianship,
reading notes and guitar techniques. We also provide training for students
who are interested in becoming student conductors. Everyone is welcome
to join - you do not need to have any guitar or music background to be
part of our ensemble. Come and enjoy the experience of growing as a musician.
Be a guitarist, six strings attached.</p>
