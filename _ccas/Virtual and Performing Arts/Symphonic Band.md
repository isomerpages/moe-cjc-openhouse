<h2>Symphonic Band</h2>
<p>The Catholic Junior College Symphonic Band started 22 years ago in 1998
as a group of dedicated bandsmen who love to make music and strive for
musical excellence.</p>
<p>Today, we still hold true to that ideal to enjoy the experience of playing
as a band, as one big family, we work together regardless of prior experience,
towards a common goal of achieving one, complete band sound.</p>
<p>Come join our community of music lovers as we work towards SYF and concert
performances, and have fun through exchanges and band-themed bonding activities.</p>
