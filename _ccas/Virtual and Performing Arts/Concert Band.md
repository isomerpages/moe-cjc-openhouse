## CJC Concert Band
The Catholic Junior College Concert Band started 22 years ago in 1998 as a group of dedicated bandsmen who love to make music and strive for musical excellence.

  

Today, we still hold true to that ideal to enjoy the experience of playing as a band, as one big family, we work together regardless of prior experience, towards a common goal of achieving one, complete band sound.

  

Come join our community of music lovers as we work towards SYF and concert performances, and have fun through exchanges and band-themed bonding activities.
