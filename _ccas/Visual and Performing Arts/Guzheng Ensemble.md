<h2>Guzheng Ensemble</h2>
<p>The CJ Guzheng Ensemble provides opportunities for interested students
to learn and master the skills of playing the Guzheng through various performance
opportunities at SYF and CJ Celebrates.</p>
<p>As guzheng is a Chinese string instrument, it definitely allows for a
greater appreciation of Chinese culture and music. However, you do not
need to be well-versed in Chinese/Mandarin to be part of us!</p>
<p>Guys and Girls, everyone is welcome to join - you do not need to have
any musical background to be part of our ensemble. We are a closely-knit
family in tune with one another.</p>
