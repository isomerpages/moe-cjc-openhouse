A newly formed 2nd CCA that aims to promote holistic Christian Formation in a Catholic Mission School.

  

It comprises a Formation and Music Ministry, which allows Students to serve God in areas of music or faith formation.

  

We meet once a fortnight for Cell Groups and Social events and have ad-hoc formation and service learning projects that occur on a termly basis.

  

If you wish to experience the support of a faith-based community as you go through JC life, do join us!
