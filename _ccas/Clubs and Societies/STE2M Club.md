<p>The STE<sup>2</sup>M Club is committed to developing our students to be <strong>Champions for sustainable living through STEM</strong>.
With a firm belief that there is an increasing urgency to protect our planet
for future generations, our students are given opportunities to acquire
and apply their knowledge, develop <strong>STEM solutions through research and create prototypes through equipment such as 3D printers and laser cutter</strong> to
address the effects of environmental issues affecting the college and in
the community.</p>
