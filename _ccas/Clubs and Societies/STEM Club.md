The STE2M Club is committed to developing our students to be **Champions for sustainable living through STEM**. With a firm belief that there is an increasing urgency to protect our planet for future generations, our students are given opportunities to acquire and apply their knowledge, develop **STEM solutions through research and create prototypes through equipment such as 3D printers and laser cutter** to address the effects of environmental issues affecting the college and in the community.
