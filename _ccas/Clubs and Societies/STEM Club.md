The STEM Club is committed to **raising awareness** of the effects of environmental issues as well as **advocating for change** to address these effects. With a firm belief in needing to conserve our planet for future generations, we **champion green habits and ideas** in the school campus by organising events to provide opportunities for all in the college to **play an active role** in caring for our environment.
