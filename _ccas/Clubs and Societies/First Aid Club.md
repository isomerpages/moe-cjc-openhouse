**FIRST**&nbsp;to be there, dare to be&nbsp;**FIRST**.

  

Welcome to join us if you are keen to hone your&nbsp;**first aid skills**. Together with Singapore Red Cross, we organise in-house&nbsp;**Blood Donation Drives**. Besides standby&nbsp;**first aid duty**&nbsp;at various school events, we&nbsp;**teach first aid skills**&nbsp;at the Sports Leaders Workshop.

Interested students, please refer to the CCA Notice Board.

  

Prior experience in First Aid is not necessary.
