Judo is not simply an ancient Japanese martial art form but a way of life. It translates as “the gentle way” in English.

  

In CJC Judo, you will learn the value of humility and respect, as well as the importance of tactical thinking over absolute strength.

  

This is a fulfilling sport where you can learn skills that stay with you for life.

#### **Attire:**

Wear PE attire for trials
