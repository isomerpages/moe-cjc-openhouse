Want to develop critical thinking and a sense of discipline? Through Fencing, all this is developed through expert training and competition opportunities. Fencing provides much self-discipline thinking fast on your feet, while cultivating immense self-control!

  

We welcome both experienced fencers and those new to fencing!

  

Eventually if you are allocated fencing as your CCA, you will be required to purchase a full set of fencing attire and the corresponding weapon category you are participating in.
