Keen to try a lesser-known sport like Shooting?

Ever wondered what it’s like to do sport with minimal movement and communication?

  

A&nbsp;**precision sport**&nbsp;that is a far cry from the huffing and puffing you’d expect on the court or the track, Shooting is an invitation to&nbsp;**develop needle-sharp focus and grace under pressure**.

  

Feeling daunted but intrigued by the sport?

  

Rest assured, though experience is preferred&nbsp;**we are really looking for great learners and team players who are raring to go**!

  

We can’t wait to meet you! We usually train on Wednesdays and Fridays at our&nbsp;**convenient in-school shooting range**.
