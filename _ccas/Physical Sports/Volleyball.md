CJC Volleyball offers you the opportunity to **build character** through achieving sports excellence and working in teams. There are both girls and boys teams, helmed by two experienced coaches and guided by four teachers. Together, we strive to impart life skills such as **resilience and effective communication** via the exciting game of volleyball. As a unique team sport that demands a high level of teamwork, we envision that our students will develop **discipline, sportsmanship and forge meaningful friendships**.

  

If you have prior experience in the sport, do join us! It will be a great way to **share your expertise with potential teammates**, continue to excel and **explore leadership opportunities**.

  

Keen to **learn a new sport**? We have just the thing for you! We have two competitive teams representing the college and non-competitive teams, where training sessions are about **learning through game play**.
