All are welcome to join us regardless of playing experience and skill level.

Tennis teaches sportsmanship, teamwork, discipline, hard work, team bonding, and forehands, backhands, serves and volleys.

It is fulfilling, enriching and provides you with a useful skill for life! Opportunities to develop and compete are available to ensure time spent in CCA is well spent.
